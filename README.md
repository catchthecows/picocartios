* Ongoing experiment of porting some PICO-8 tweetcarts to swift and running them on iPhone.  

I here the choruses of "But why?!"

1. Because people making pico-8 tweetcarts do amazing things and I want to understand the math and methods to the madness better.
2. Because trying to implement things in a port is a great way to learn details of a system.  Like how quickly you learn that the pico-8 sin and cos use a range of 0-1. 
3. Because it is fun.
